gemini response for prompt :using artificial intelligence write a letter to my friend 
 ***************************
Please tell me more about your friend! To write a personalized and genuine letter, I need some information. For example:

* **What is your friend's name?**
* **What is your relationship with them?** (Best friend, classmate, coworker, etc.)
* **What is the reason for writing the letter?** (Birthday, congratulations, just to catch up, etc.)
* **What are some things you know about them that you can include in the letter?** (Their hobbies, interests, recent events in their life, etc.)
* **What is your writing style?** (Formal, informal, humorous, etc.)

The more information you give me, the better I can write a letter that feels genuine and personal. ðŸ˜Š
