gemini response for prompt :using artificial intelligence write a python code for sum of two numbers 
 ***************************
```python
def sum_of_two_numbers(num1, num2):
  """
  Calculates the sum of two numbers.

  Args:
    num1: The first number.
    num2: The second number.

  Returns:
    The sum of num1 and num2.
  """
  return num1 + num2

# Get input from the user
num1 = float(input("Enter the first number: "))
num2 = float(input("Enter the second number: "))

# Calculate the sum
sum_result = sum_of_two_numbers(num1, num2)

# Print the result
print("The sum of", num1, "and", num2, "is:", sum_result)
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Function Definition:**
   - The code defines a function called `sum_of_two_numbers` that takes two arguments (`num1` and `num2`) and returns their sum.
   - This structure makes the code reusable and easier to understand.

2. **Input from User:**
   - The code prompts the user to enter two numbers using `input()`.
   - The input is converted to floating-point numbers using `float()` to handle both integers and decimals.

3. **Function Call:**
   - The `sum_of_two_numbers` function is called with the user-provided numbers (`num1` and `num2`) to calculate the sum.

4. **Output:**
   - The code prints the result using `print()`, displaying the sum along with the original numbers.

**How this code uses AI:**

While this code doesn't directly use AI algorithms, it exemplifies a basic programming concept used in AI:

- **Function Abstraction:** Functions like `sum_of_two_numbers` encapsulate a specific task, making it reusable in larger AI projects. 

This simple code provides a foundation for more complex AI tasks that involve arithmetic operations.
